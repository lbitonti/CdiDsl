CDI extension module that provides a DSL with guice-like syntax for composing applications on top of CDI as documented at:

http://www.seamframework.org/Weld/PortableExtensionsPackage#H-GuicestyleConfigurationAPI
 
To use in a CDI application:

- Create a class that extends Module and override the configure() method.
- Register your module as a service provider by creating a file named META-INF/services/di.sample.cdi.dsl.Module which contains the name of your module (e.g. di.sample.cdi.dsl.test.palindrome.AppModule).

See tests for an example.


NOTE: this works in the few use cases I've currently tested it with but it's still rather "rough", so you should handle it with care!
